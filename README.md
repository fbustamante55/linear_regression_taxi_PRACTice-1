Colabs
Machine Learning Crash Course uses Colaboratories (Colabs) for all programming exercises. Colab is Google's implementation of Jupyter Notebook. For more information about Colabs and how to use them, go to Welcome to Colaboratory.

Linear Regression
In this Colab you will use a real dataset to train a model to predict the fare of a taxi ride in Chicago, Illinois.

Learning Objectives
After completing this Colab, you'll be able to:

Read a .csv file into a pandas DataFrame.
Explore a dataset with Python visualization libraries.
Experiment with different features to build a linear regression model.
Tune the model's hyperparameters.
Compare training runs using root mean squared error and loss curves.
Dataset Description
The dataset for this exercise is derived from the City of Chicago Taxi Trips dataset. The data for this exercise is a subset of the Taxi Trips data, and focuses on a two-day period in May of 2022.
