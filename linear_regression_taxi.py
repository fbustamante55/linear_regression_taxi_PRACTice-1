Machine Learning Crash Course uses Colaboratories (Colabs) for all programming exercises. Colab is Google's implementation of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). For more information about Colabs and how to use them, go to [Welcome to Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory).

# Linear Regression
In this Colab you will use a real dataset to train a model to predict the fare of a taxi ride in Chicago, Illinois.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this Colab, you'll be able to:

  * Read a .csv file into a [pandas](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#pandas) DataFrame.
  * Explore a [dataset](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#data_set) with Python visualization libraries.
  * Experiment with different [features](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#feature) to build a linear regression model.
  * Tune the model's [hyperparameters](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#hyperparameter).
  * Compare training runs using [root mean squared error](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#root-mean-squared-error-rmse) and [loss curves](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#loss-curve).

## Dataset Description
The [dataset for this exercise](https://storage.mtls.cloud.google.com/mlcc-nextgen-internal/chicago_taxi_train.csv) is derived from the [City of Chicago Taxi Trips dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew). The data for this exercise is a subset of the Taxi Trips data, and focuses on a two-day period in May of 2022.

## View dataset statistics

A large part of most machine learning projects is getting to know your data. In this step, you will use the ``DataFrame.describe`` method to view descriptive statistics about the dataset and answer some important questions about the data.

**Instructions**
1. Run the **View dataset statistics** code cell.
1. Inspect the output and answer these questions:
  * What is the maximum fare?
  * What is the mean distance across all trips?
  * How many cab companies are in the dataset?
  * What is the most frequent payment type?
  * Are any features missing data?
1. Run the code **View answers to dataset statistics** code cell to check your answers.


You might be wondering why there are groups of `NaN` (not a number) values listed in the output. When working with data in Python, you may see this value if the result of a calculation can not be computed or if there is missing information. For example, in the taxi dataset `PAYMENT_TYPE` and `COMPANY` are non-numeric, categorical features; numeric information such as mean and max do not make sense for categorical features so the output displays `NaN`.

"""## Generate a correlation matrix

An important part of machine learning is determining which [features](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#feature) correlate with the [label](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#label). If you have ever taken a taxi ride before, your experience is probably telling you that the fare is typically associated with the distance traveled and the duration of the trip. But, is there a way for you to learn more about how well these features correlate to the fare (label)?

In this step, you will use a **correlation matrix** to identify features whose values correlate well with the label. Correlation values have the following meanings:

  * **`1.0`**: perfect positive correlation; that is, when one attribute rises, the other attribute rises.
  * **`-1.0`**: perfect negative correlation; that is, when one attribute rises, the other attribute falls.
  * **`0.0`**: no correlation; the two columns [are not linearly related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#/media/File:Correlation_examples2.svg).

In general, the higher the absolute value of a correlation value, the greater its predictive power.

**Instructions**

1. Inspect the code in the **View correlation matrix** code cell.
1. Run the **View correlation matrix** code cell and inspect the output.
1. **Check your understanding** by answering these questions:
  * Which feature correlates most strongly to the label FARE?
  * Which feature correlates least strongly to the label FARE?

"""## Train a model with two features

The model you trained with the feature ``TOTAL_MILES`` demonstrates fairly strong predictive power, but is it possible to do better? In this step, try training the model with two features, ``TRIP_MILES`` and ``TRIP_MINUTES``, to see if you can improve the model. You may recall that the original dataset does not include a feature ``TRIP_MINUTES``, but this feature can be easily derived from ``TRIP_SECONDS`` as shown in the code below.*

**Instructions**
1. Review the code in **Experiment 3** code cell.
1. Run the **Experiment 3** code cell.
1. Review the output from the training run and answer these questions:
  * Does the model with two features produce better results than one using a single feature?
  * Does it make a difference if you use ``TRIP_SECONDS`` instead of ``TRIP_MINUTES``?
  * How well do you think the model comes to the ground truth fare calculation for Chicago Taxi Trips?


Notice that the scatter plot of the features vs. the label is a three dimensional (3-D) plot. This representation allows you to visualize both features and the label all together. The two features (TRIP_MILES and TRIP_MINUTES) are on the x and y axis, and the label (FARE) is on the z axis. The plot shows individual examples in the dataset as circles, and the model as a surface (plane). With this 3-D model, if the trained model is good you would expect most of the examples to land on the plane surface. The 3-D plot is interactive so you can explore the data further by clicking or dragging the plot.

To answer this question for your specific training runs, compare the RMSE for
each model. For example, if the RMSE for the model trained with one feature was
3.7457 and the RMSE for the model with two features is 3.4787, that means that
on average the model with two features makes predictions that are about $0.27
closer to the observed fare.

When training a model with more than one feature, it is important that all
numeric values are roughly on the same scale. In this case, TRIP_SECONDS and
TRIP_MILES do not meet this criteria. The mean value for TRIP_MILES is 8.3 and
the mean for TRIP_SECONDS is 1,320; that is two orders of magnitude difference.
In contrast, the mean for TRIP_MINUTES is 22, which is more similar to the scale
of TRIP_MILES (8.3) than TRIP_SECONDS (1,320). Of course, this is not the
only way to scale values before training, but you will learn about that in
another module.

In reality, Chicago taxi cabs use a documented formula to determine cab fares.

Typically with machine learning problems you would not know the 'correct'
formula, but in this case you can use this knowledge to evaluate your model.
Take a look at your model output (the weights and bias) and determine how
well it matches the ground truth fare calculation. You should find that the
